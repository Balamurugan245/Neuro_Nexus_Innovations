Task1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION 

step 1: data collection

step 2: data cleaning

step 3: balancing the dataset(oversampling)

step 4: train test split

step 5: model development

step 6: evaluate of the model

Linear Regression gave a best score for TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION 

Task2 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

step 1: data collection

step 2: data cleaning

step 3: balancing the dataset (oversampling and undersampling)

step 4: train test split

step 5: model development

step 6: evaluate of the model

RandomForestRegressor gave a best score for CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
